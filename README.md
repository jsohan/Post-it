# Description: 
An image sharing app that allows you to sign in or create an account. Once logged in you can subscribe and un-subscribe from various "folders" which should contain images on that subject (ex. Kitten folder containing images of kittens). You can also share images to these folders or to the main “public” feed which everyone can see without subscribing. Each user also has their own “private” folder where they can upload images for their eyes only.
